Homework For Module 3 - Python

In this weeks HW Prof Booth has taksed us with looping through two data sets: py_bank and py_poll. For py_bank, we needed to find the total number of months, the total profit/loss for all the months, average change, greatest increase, and the greatest decrease. We also need to print these results to the terminal and a seperate txt file. For py_poll, we were tasked with finding the totlal number of votes, total votes for each candidate, the percentage of votes for each candidate, and the winner of the election. We also needed to print the results to the terminal and a seperate txt file.
